        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm (way of organizing code) that is based on the concept of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class is a blueprint or template in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that defines the structure and behavior of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object is a real-world entity created from a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction means hiding features not meant to be shown.\n",
        "- Encapsulation means wrapping code into single unit.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder methods are magic methods used in class to control the output of operators and inbuilt functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "- Child class inheriting attributes and methods of parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- In OOP, polymorphism means the same function/method/operator can have different behaviors depending on the object or data type.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- By creating class attributes and functions inside a class.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- __init__() is a constructor which is called when an object is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- **Class methods** are methods that are bound to the class and not the instance of the class. They are defined using the `@classmethod` decorator and take the class itself as the first argument, conventionally named `cls`.\n",
        "- **Static methods** are methods that are bound neither to the class nor the instance. They are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator and do not take `self` or `cls` as the first argument. Static methods are often used for utility functions that are related to the class but do not need access to class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- **Method overloading** is the ability to define multiple methods with the same name within a class, where each method has a different number or type of parameters. Python does not directly support method overloading in the same way that some other languages like Java or C++ do. However, you can achieve similar behavior using default arguments, variable-length arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`), or by checking the type of arguments within the method.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- **Method overriding** is a feature of OOP where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to change the behavior of the inherited method.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- A **property decorator** (`@property`) is a built-in decorator in Python that provides a way to define methods within a class that can be accessed like attributes. It's commonly used to create getter, setter, and deleter methods for managing access to instance variables, allowing you to add logic when getting or setting an attribute's value.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- **Polymorphism** is important in OOP because it promotes code reusability, flexibility, and maintainability. It allows you to write code that can work with objects of different classes in a uniform way, as long as those classes share a common interface or base class. This makes the code more adaptable to changes and easier to extend.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An **abstract class** is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own. It is designed to be a blueprint for other classes and often contains one or more abstract methods, which are methods declared in the abstract class but implemented by its concrete subclasses. In Python, you can create abstract classes using the `abc` module and the `@abstractmethod` decorator.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- The advantages of OOP include:\n",
        "    - **Reusability:** Code can be reused through inheritance.\n",
        "    - **Maintainability:** Code is easier to maintain and modify.\n",
        "    - **Flexibility:** Objects can be easily modified and extended.\n",
        "    - **Abstraction and Encapsulation:** Data and behavior are bundled together, and implementation details can be hidden.\n",
        "    - **Polymorphism:** Allows for writing flexible and generic code.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- A **class variable** is a variable that is shared among all instances of a class. It is defined within the class but outside of any methods. Class variables are the same for all objects of that class.\n",
        "- An **instance variable** is a variable that is unique to each instance (object) of a class. It is defined within a method (usually `__init__`) using `self`. Instance variables have different values for different objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- **Multiple inheritance** is a feature in Python where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This allows a class to combine the characteristics of multiple classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python.\n",
        "- The `__str__` method is used to provide a user-friendly string representation of an object. It is called by functions like `str()` and `print()`.\n",
        "- The `__repr__` method is used to provide an unambiguous string representation of an object, often used for debugging and development. It should aim to be a valid Python expression that could be used to recreate the object. If `__str__` is not defined, `__repr__` is used as a fallback.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "- The `super()` function in Python is used to refer to the parent class (or superclass) in an inheritance hierarchy. It is commonly used to call methods of the parent class, especially when overriding those methods in the child class. It helps in avoiding the need to explicitly name the parent class, making the code more maintainable when class names change.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The `__del__` method, also known as the destructor, is called when an object is about to be garbage collected (i.e., when its reference count drops to zero). It is typically used to perform cleanup tasks, such as closing files or releasing resources. However, the exact timing of when `__del__` is called is not guaranteed due to Python's garbage collection mechanism, so it's often better to use context managers or explicit cleanup methods when reliable resource management is needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- The main difference lies in their first argument:\n",
        "    - `@staticmethod` does not take any implicit first argument. It behaves like a regular function but is defined within a class because it is logically related to the class.\n",
        "    - `@classmethod` takes the class itself as the first argument (`cls`). It can access and modify class state but not instance state. It is often used for factory methods or methods that operate on the class itself.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- Polymorphism with inheritance in Python allows a subclass object to be treated as an object of its superclass. If a method is defined in the superclass and overridden in the subclass, calling that method on a subclass object (even when treated as a superclass object) will execute the subclass's implementation. This is often demonstrated through method overriding and duck typing, where the focus is on what an object can do rather than its specific type.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- **Method chaining** is a programming technique where multiple method calls are linked together in a single expression. This is achieved when each method in the chain returns the object itself (`self`), allowing the next method to be called on the result. It makes the code more concise and readable, especially when performing a series of operations on an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The `__call__` method allows an instance of a class to be called like a function. If a class defines `__call__`, you can create an object of that class and then use parentheses `()` after the object name to execute the code within the `__call__` method. This is useful for creating objects that behave like functions or for implementing decorators."
